Hi! 

I'm Vathsala and I have been coding with Python since 2011. Since last year I've been trying new languages and frameworks, like React and GraphQL. This year I'm focussing on Go and Typescript.


Here's a little bit about me:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on problem solving (Project Euler), learning Go on codecrafters and Typescript basics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in contributing to and mainting open source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about returning to Tech after a looooong break
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got into coding when I was 8 years old, but seriously fell in love with logic and programming at 12/13
