Hi! 

I'm Vathsala and I have been coding with Python since 2011. This year I've been trying new languages and frameworks, most recently React and GraphQL.


Here's a little bit about me:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on problem solving (Project Euler)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning Typescript
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about being a Woman in Tech
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding when I was 8 years old
