Hi! 

I'm Vathsala, a Jack of all Trades and I prefer it that way. I have spent most of my Tech career coding in Python, but this year I've started learning new languages and frameworks. I've recently worked on React and GraphQL.


Here's a little bit about me:


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Ruminate Project
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript, React and Firebase
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about being a Woman in Tech
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding when I was 8 years old
